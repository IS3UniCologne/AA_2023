# AA_2023

Welcome to the repository of the course "Analytics and Applications(AA)". 
We will use this space as the central point for sharing code, data and 
instructions with you over the course of this semester.

You should check this repo regularly to view and/or download newly 
released or updated files. If you have experience using git or if you want 
to learn how to work with a state-of-the-art version control system, you 
may wish to fork and regularly pull updates to the repository onto your 
local machine for convenience.
